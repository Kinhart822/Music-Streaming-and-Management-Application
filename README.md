# **Music Streaming and Management Application**

### **Overview**  
The Music Streaming and Management Application is a robust, full-featured platform designed to connect artists with listeners while giving administrators control over content quality and user management. The system delivers an engaging Android app for users to explore and enjoy music and powerful web interfaces for artists to manage their work and for admins to moderate and maintain the platform effectively.

### **Future Works**  
I am currently learning:
+ Firebase and WebSocket, and how to integrate with the backend server for the purpose of making real-time notifications for both cases, Artist and User.
+ Docker and deployment techniques to move the application from a local development environment to a publicly accessible hosting environment (e.g., cloud server or container platform). This will enable anyone to access and test the application without a local setup.
